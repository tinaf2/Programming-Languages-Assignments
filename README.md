hw1 - Fixed point theory and grammar optimization filter in OCaml.

hw2 - Recursive-descent parser for context-free grammars in OCaml.

hw3 - Multithreading in Java: Java program called Pigzj that performs parallel compression using multiple threads, similar to the behavior of the pigz C implementation, but simplified to focus only on compression, supporting a limited set of options, and ensuring compatibility with gzip decompression.

hw4 - Tower solver implementation in Prolog (logical programming).

hw5 - Scheme procedure to compare Scheme expressions, highlighting variations such as identifier renaming and changes in lambda notation.

Project - Implementation of a Python-based asyncio application server herd prototype for a news service, exploring the potential of asyncio as a replacement for the Wikipedia platform. It includes creating servers that communicate bidirectionally, handle client commands like IAMAT and WHATSAT, and interact with Google Places API asynchronously.
