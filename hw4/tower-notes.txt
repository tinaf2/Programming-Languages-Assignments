1. Speedup:
| ?- speedup(Ratio).
Ratio = 1.33048128342246

2. An ambiguous puzzle found for N = 5:
| ?- ambiguous(5, C, T1, T2).

C = counts([4,2,3,2,1],[1,3,2,3,2],[5,3,2,3,1],[1,2,3,2,2])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,1,4,5,3],[4,5,2,3,1],[3,4,5,1,2],[5,3,1,2,4]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[3,1,4,5,2],[4,5,2,3,1],[2,4,5,1,3],[5,3,1,2,4]] ?
